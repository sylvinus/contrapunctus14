I registered the domain [contrapunctus14.org](https://contrapunctus14.org) back in 2008 and for 15 years (!) it has been
sitting defiantly in my list of future side projects.

Not anymore!

I am now finally starting this project to expand on my longstanding fascination with this Fugue and try to build
the definitive online resource about it.

I will explain more later about my personal connection with this piece of music, but the fact that is was left unfinished feels like an amazing challenge to take on.

The first phase of this project will be about collecting and referencing everything that has already been written.
This includes articles, theses and of course existing completions.

What I hope to achieve next is more ambitious, but with the recent rise of [Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) it should be feasible to train Machine Learning models on all of Bach's works and steer them towards proposing novel completions that take into account all of the clues that he left us.

What an exciting journey!
